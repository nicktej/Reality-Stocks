    <!-- 
This is a simple example of using Javascript with the LeapMotion.
All that this does is to open the LeapMotion and look for a few gestures of different types.
When these are detected counters will appear and be incremented in the html
on the page.
A swipe gesture is defined as "something" moving from one side of the field
of view to the other side.  Note that individual fingers are counted so
a single finger being observed will be seen as one swipe.
A tap gesture is equivalent to poking at the screen.

The debug var can be set to 0 or non-zero and the larger the number
the increased level of debug output to the JS console if you turn on developer mode
in your browser.  I am primarily using Chrome but Safari also works for me.

This page was very helpful while working on this:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18018642/detecting-swipe-gesture-direction-with-leap-motion

The webpage should look something like this if you have a LeapMotion attached

Hey, you've got a LeapMotion attached, cool!
numSwipes 16, left 9, right 7, taps 2


I wanted this to be a complete and working example so if you have any suggestions on how to
improve it please let me know.
